We could explicitly type out each integer, but that is not very efficient. Instead, we can use range to accomplish this task. We can provide a range with a start and stop value to create this sequence. Or, we can provide just a stop value assuming that we want our sequence to start at zero. Notice that the stop value is exclusive, or up to but not including this value. Also note the range function returns a range object, which we can convert into a list and print. The range function can also accept a start, stop, and step value (in that order)."
